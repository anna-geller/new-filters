Layout Questions and answers:

Filter Wrapping Logic: When filters don't fit in the first row between Search and Save filter, should I prioritize certain filters to stay in the first row? Or should it be purely based on available space?

Based on available space and the order of filters in the “Customize Filters” menu. Note that the “Customize Filters” shows filters in a specific order that user can drag to reorder. All visible (not hidden) filters should show up exactly in that order in the first and subsequent rows.

Time Range Default: You mentioned "7 days being the default for Time range" - should this automatically show as an active filter on page load, or only when explicitly selected?

Yes, it should show as an active filter on page load. 

Reset Button: Should the reset button clear ALL filters (including search and time range), or only the additional filters, leaving search empty and time range at default?

The Reset button should clear only the additional filters that user manually applied (or applied by selecting a given Saved filter), leaving search empty and time range at default.

Filter Implementation Questions:

Labels Filter Complexity: The Labels filter has 7 different operators with colored icons. Should I implement this as a modal/popover like the State filter, or as an inline editor below the filter badge?

as a modal/popover like the State filter, but keep in mind that clicking anywhere on the screen outside of this modal/popover should hide the modal (same effect as clicking on Cancel)

Namespace Filter Data: For the Namespace filter with its multiselect functionality, do you have specific namespace values I should use, or should I create a reasonable set of example values for now?

Create reasonable set of examples. The ones currently shown such as company, company.team, company.team.backend, company.team.frontend, company.analytics, company.security are a great start!

Save Filter & Saved Filters: Are these buttons functional in the current implementation, or should I implement basic functionality for them as part of this restructure?

They are not functional yet, but the way they should work is that once user applied multiple filters with all dropdown options etc, they can save their current filter settings with a name, then quickly reload those exact same filters later from the “Saved filters” dropdown menu. The system stores filter values in component state and provides UI buttons to save, load, and delete these named filter sets.

Visual Design Questions:

Green Operators: In the FilterBadge component, you want operators in green and values in white. Should this be a text color change within the existing badge styling, or do you want a more distinct visual separation?

Yes exactly, just a text color change within the existing badge styling

Filter Icons: I see the Customize filters button should have a filter icon on the left (currently uses Settings icon). Should other filters have specific icons, or just the pencil/X icons for edit/clear?

just the pencil/X icons for edit/clear
