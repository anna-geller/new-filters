Remove the word “selected” in applied filters e.g. instead of “State in 2 selected”, the applied filter badge can show “State in 2”

Currently Saved filters can’t be edited, please fix it. Also, don’t allow saving 2 filters with the same name, show a friendly error message then.

when clicking anywhere outside of the “Columns” module, hide that popover similarly how this is handled by the “Customize filters” popover

Unify the behavior of jumping to the filter edit mode once enabled/made visible. Currently, when you enable the Namespace filter, it will jump to the Edit mode for that filter. Apply the same to all filters e.g. on the State filter that behavior isn’t applied yet. 

When disabling a given filter (making it invisible from “Customize filters” panel), make sure anything applied for that filter is removed without having to first clear it manually.

Adjust the Operators on Labels to replace IN and NOT IN by more explicit handling of logical AND, OR and NOT conditions and also adjust their description:

has any of

Matches at least one of the selected labels (OR)

has none of

Matches none of the selected labels (NOT OR)

has all of

Matches all of the selected labels (AND)

contains

Key or value contains the text (LIKE)

does not contain

Key or value does not contain the text (NOT LIKE)

is set

Key exists, with any value (IS NOT NULL)

is not set

Key does not exist (IS NULL)

Change how Labels look like in the table and how they behave: use a stronger contrast to make them stand out from the table color. They should also be clickable: if user clicks on any label key-value pair, that key-value pair should be added to Labels filter under the HAS ALL OF Operator and should be treated as logical AND e.g. if user clicks on env:production label and then on team:backend label, then this should reduce the result set to only executions that simultaneously have both of these labels 

The Subflow filter is wrong. It is supposed to be a simple single-select dropdown with options 

All Executions: Shows both main flows and subflows executions

Child Executions: Shows only child executions

Parent Executions: Shows only parent executions

When the Show Chart toggle is enabled, display a small chart between the filter bar and the table, similar to the screenshot 

Add the NOT IN operator to the State filter 

The Namespace filter should allow operators IN, NOT IN, CONTAINS, STARTS_WITH, ENDS_WITH. Currently, the multiselect dropdown can be used for the IN and NOT IN use case, however make sure to add the Filter Operator, similarly to how this is handled for the Labels filter. 

Make sure that the Operators work i.e. ensure that they filter data in the table. You can show all table columns by default and produce some random data to allow testing filtering for all operator use cases.
