| `logToFile`     | A boolean that lets you store logs as a file in internal storage. That file can be previewed and downloaded from the Logs and Gantt Execution tabs. When set to `true`, logs aren’t saved in the database, which is useful for tasks that produce a large amount of logs that would otherwise take up too much space. The same property can be set on triggers. |
